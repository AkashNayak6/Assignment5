# Assignment 5: Spanning Trees, Shortest Path, Maximum Flow

This assignment consists of analysis' and usage of MST, Kruskal's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, Eager Prim's Algorithm, Bellman Ford Algorithm, Djikstra’s Algorithm, Topological Sort Algorithm, DAG, Maximum Flow, Ford Fulkerson Algorithm, augment path, BFS, DFS, and Priority Queue.

Overview of Questions 1-10 -->

Question 1: The list of edges, in tabular form, of the MST for Kruskal’s Algorithm and Prim's Algorithm

Question 2: How does Kruskal’s Algorithm and Prim's Algorithm implement cycle detection?

Question 3: What happens if you apply Kruskal and Prim’s algorithm to a directed graph?

Question 4: Explain the differences in these two implementations by highlighting the changed parts(from naïve to eager) and explain how this affects space and time complexities for Prim's and Eager Prim's Algorithm

Question 5: Write pseudocode for linear algorithms (in terms of V /E/V and E) algorithm that can validate whether the tree is still a Minimum Spanning Tree in these events:

a. An edge is added to the graph G

b. An edge of not in the tree in made smaller

c. An edge in the tree is made larger

Question 6: For the graph below, complete the following for a shortest path from A to B:

a. Bellman Ford Algorithm.

b. Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

c. Topological Sort Algorithm.

Question 7: Explain why the Topological Sort Algorithm requires a DAG. What happens when you run the algorithm on a non-DAG?

Question 8: Why do we not implement a cycle detection for Dijkstra’s Algorithm, despite the fact that Prim’s Algorithm for the MST -- which is nearly the same as Dijkstra’s – does?

Question 9: Why does Dijkstra’s Algorithm fail for negative edge weights?

Question 10: Given the graph below, do the following:

a. Find the Maximum Flow from s to t using the Ford Fulkerson Algorithm

b. Find the mincut of the above graph

c. Find the mincut capacity
